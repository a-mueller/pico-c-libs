# My Pico C SDK libraries

## Warning
I have no idea what I am doing.

## Contents

### pico_sleep_utility
Utility to help put the pico into deep sleep and wake up when either of two GPIOs is high. Useful if you have an external RTC and a button. Requires the pico extra stuff.

### pico_sht45
Very basic support for the SHT45, can just run the measure command.
